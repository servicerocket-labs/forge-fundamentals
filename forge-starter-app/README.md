# Forge Starter App

## Quick start

- Build and deploy your app by running:

```
forge deploy
```

- Install your app in an Atlassian site by running:

```
forge install
```

- Develop your app by running `forge tunnel` to proxy invocations locally:

```
forge tunnel
```

### Notes

- Use the `forge deploy` command when you want to persist code changes.
- Use the `forge install` command when you want to install the app on a new site.
- Once the app is installed on a site, the site picks up the new app changes you deploy without needing to rerun the install command.
